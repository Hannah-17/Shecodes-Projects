  <p> Exercise is the miracle cure we've always had, but for too long we've neglected to take our recommended dose. Our health
is now suffering as a consequence.

This is no snake oil. Whatever your age, there's strong scientific evidence that being physically active can help you
lead a healthier and happier life.

People who exercise regularly have a lower risk of developing many long-term (chronic) conditions, such as heart
disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and some cancers.

<br/>

  <p> 
Research shows that physical activity can also boost self-esteem, mood, sleep quality and energy, as well as reducing
your risk of stress, clinical depression, dementia and Alzheimer's disease.
For most people, the easiest way to get moving is to make activity part of everyday life, like walking for health or
cycling instead of using the car to get around. However, the more you do, the better, and taking part in activities such
as sports and exercise will make you even healthier.

Here are a list of exercises to do in your next gym session:
